DECOMISSIONING
==============

The NBN gateway services which rnbn uses are being stopped in March 2017. At this time rnbn will stop working. We hope to eventually replace rnbn with another r-package that will use the new NBN servies being launched.

For updates on the new package or to contribute plese find more details at: https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/NBN4R
