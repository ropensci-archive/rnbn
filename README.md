DECOMISSIONING
==============

The NBN gateway services which rnbn uses are being stopped in March 2017. At this time rnbn will stop working. We hope to be able to replace rnbn with another r-package that will use the new NBN servies being launched. Updates will be posted on the rnbn Github pages https://github.com/ropensci/rnbn
